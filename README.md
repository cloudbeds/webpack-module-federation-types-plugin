# module-federation-types-plugin

This package exposes a Webpack plugin and a node CLI command `make-federated-types`.

It compiles types into a _dist/@types/index.d.ts_ file and downloads
compiled remote types from other federated microapps into _src/@types/remotes_ folder.

Global type definitions from _src/@types/*.d.ts_ are included in compilation.

All paths can be customized to meet your environment.

## Installation

```sh
npm i @cloudbeds/webpack-module-federation-types-plugin
```

## CLI Tool

The standalone `make-federated-types` script compiles types to the _dist/@types_ folder, the same way as the plugin does.
It is useful for testing and debugging purposes or when it is not desired to update types automatically during the build process.

This script should not be used in CI as the `build` script, that executes the plugin, already writes the types.

The main requirement for the tool is the existance of a `federation.config.json` file.

It can be called like so:

```sh
npx make-federated-types
```

Or it can be added to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "make-types": "make-federated-types"
  }
}
```

### CLI options

#### download-federated-types
| Option                        | Default value       | Description                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| `--webpack-config`            | `webpack.config.js` | Path to webpack config file |

If the config is written in TypeScript, the script should be called with `ts-node`. _Example:_

```
ts-node node_modules/bin/download-federated-types --webpack-config webpack/prod.ts
```

#### make-federated-types
| Option                        | Default value       | Description                                                                    |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--output-types-folder`, `-o` | `dist/@types`       | Path to the output folder, absolute or relative to the working directory       |
| `--global-types`, `-g`        | `src/@types`        | Path to project's global ambient type definitions, relative to the working dir |
| `--federation-config`, `-c`   | `src/@types`        | Path to federation.config, relative to the working dir                         |
| `--tsconfig`, `-t`            | `src/@types`        | Path to tsconfig.json, relative to the working dir                             |
| `--webpack-config`            | `webpack.config.js` | Path to webpack.config.js                                                      |

## Plugin Configuration

### Exposed modules

Create a `federation.config.json` that will contain the remote name and exported members.
This file is mandatory for the standalone script but not required for the plugin.

Properties of this object can be used in Webpack's `ModuleFederationPlugin`
configuration object and required by the standalone script. Example:

### `federation.config.json`

Requirements:

- all paths must be relative to the project root
- the `/index` file name suffix is mandatory (without file extension)

```json
{
  "name": "microapp-42",
  "exposes": {
    "./Button": "./src/view-layer/components/Button",
    "./Portal": "./src/view-layer/index",
    "./Http": "./src/wmf-expose/Http"
  }
}
```

### `webpack.config.js`

Spread these properties into your `ModuleFederationPlugin` configuration and add `ModuleFederationTypesPlugin` to every
microapp, like so:

```js
import webpack from 'webpack';
import { ModuleFederationTypesPlugin } from '@cloudbeds/webpack-module-federation-types-plugin';

import federationConfig from '../federation.config.json';

const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = webpack.container;

module.exports = {
  /* ... */
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      ...federationConfig,
      filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
      shared: {
        ...require('./package.json').dependencies,
      },
    }),
    new ModuleFederationTypesPlugin({
      downloadTypesWhenIdleIntervalInSeconds: 120,
    }),
  ],
}
```

To enable verbose logging add folowing in webpack config:

```js
  infrastructureLogging: {
    level: 'log'
  }
```

## Consuming remote types

When you build your microapp, the plugin will download typings to _src/@types/remotes_ folder

Modules that are not intended to be imported are prefixed with `#not-for-import/`.
These are the modules that were imported in compiled exposed modules but not listed in `exposes` section.
To remain swift and unobtrusive, compiled types are not processed with an AST visitor like esprima.
That said PRs are welcome if someone sees a better solution.

## Templated Remote URLs

Templated URLs are URLs to the external remotes that are substituted in runtime using a syntax that is used in
[module-federation/external-remotes-plugin](https://github.com/module-federation/external-remotes-plugin)

_Example:_ for a `mfeApp` remote entry:

```js
{ mfeApp: 'mfeApp@[mfeAppUrl]/remoteEntry.js' }
```

The `[mfeAppUrl]` placeholder refers to `window.mfeAppUrl` in runtime.
There are several ways one can resolve this placeholder:

  * `remoteEntryUrls` option
  * `remoteManifestUrls` or `remoteManifestUrl` option

The `remoteEntryUrls` option is a simple key-value map of remote names and their bundle's base URL.

### Remote Manifest files

Manifest files, when provided, are fetched every time the types are downloded.

Example of a configuration:

```js
new ModuleFederationTypesPlugin({
  remoteManifestUrls: {
    mfeApp1: 'http://localhost:4480/remotes/dev/mfe-app-1-remote-entry.json',
    mfeApp2: 'http://localhost:4480/remotes/dev/mfe-app-2-remote-entry.json',
    registry: 'http://localhost:4480/remotes/dev/remote-entries.json',
  }
})
```

Example with a single manifest file:

```js
new ModuleFederationTypesPlugin({
  remoteManifestUrl: 'http://localhost:4480/remotes/dev/remote-entries.json',
})
```

It's expected that a JSON will contain an object with a `url` property:

```json
{
  "url": "https://assets.mydomain.com/mfe-app/remoteEntry.js"
}
```

For the `registry` field in `remoteManifestUrls` or for the single `remoteManifestUrl` option,
multiple remote entry URLs can be substituted in a single JSON file.
Depending on your architecture, this could be the only URL that you need to specify.
Example of a `remote-entries.json` file for a Prod environment:


```json
[
  {
    "scope": "mfeApp1",
    "url": "https://assets.mydomain.com/mfe-app-1/remoteEntry.js"
  },
  {
    "scope": "mfeApp2",
    "url": "https://assets.mydomain.com/mfe-app-2/remoteEntry.js"
  },
  {
    "scope": "mfeApp3",
    "url": "https://assets.mydomain.com/mfe-app-3/remoteEntry.js"
  }
]
```

An alternative format for the manifest is an object:

```json
{
  "mfe-app-1": "https://assets.mydomain.com/mfe-app-1/remoteEntry.js",
  "mfe-app-2": "https://assets.mydomain.com/mfe-app-2/remoteEntry.js",
  "mfe-app-3": "https://assets.mydomain.com/mfe-app-3/remoteEntry.js"
}
```

Note that in this case the key is converted to kebabCase and used as a scope name.

You can have registries with URLs that target bundles that was built for specific deployment environment.

The origin of the microapp's URL is used as the base URL for downloaded types

Example: `https://assets.mydomain.com/mfe-app-1/@types/index.d.ts`

### Importing from self as from remote

It is also possible to add self as a remote entry to allow importing from self like from a remote.
Example for an `mfeApp` microapp:

```js
remotes: {
  mfeApp: 'mfeApp@[mfeAppUrl]/remoteEntry.js'
}
```

### CI/CD

It is suggested to download types in a CI workflow only when a dev branch is merged
to the `main` branch, that is the time when the deployment to dev/stage/prod is about to happen.
In this case the downloaded types will correspond to the latest versions of dependent microapps,
resulting in valid static type checking against other microapps code in their `main` branch.

When `DEPLOYMENT_ENV` env variable is set to `devbox`, remote types are not downloaded.
That is to allow a microapp to download types from dev branch of another microapp.
Otherwise, the build would fail on static type checking phase.
A dev branch of a microapp may depend on another dev branch of another microapp,
thus will have to commit those types to avoid failing workflows.

## History

Having Webpack 5 module federation architecture in place it's tedious to manually create/maintain
ambient type definitions for your packages so TypeScript can resolve the dynamic imports to their proper types.

While using `@ts-ignore` on your imports works, it is a bummer to lose intellisense and type-checking capabilities.

Inspired by several existing solutions:

- [@touk/federated-types](https://github.com/touk/federated-types)
  a fork of [pixability/federated-types](https://github.com/pixability/federated-types)
- [ruanyl/dts-loader](https://github.com/ruanyl/dts-loader)
- [ruanyl/webpack-remote-types-plugin](https://github.com/ruanyl/webpack-remote-types-plugin), a wmf remotes-aware
  downloader
  of typings that can be used also with files emitted using `@touk/federated-types`
  . [Example](https://github.com/jrandeniya/federated-types-sample).
- [@module-federation/typescript](https://app.privjs.com/buy/packageDetail?pkg=@module-federation/typescript)
  from the creator of Webpack Module Federation, Zack Jackson (aka [ScriptAlchemy](https://twitter.com/ScriptedAlchemy))

Zack Jackson was asked for help with
[several issues](https://github.com/module-federation/module-federation-examples/issues/20#issuecomment-1153131082)
around his plugin. There was a hope that he can suggest some solutions to the exposed problems, to no avail.
After a month of waiting this package was built.

*_Runtime microapp imports_ refers to templated remote URLs that are resolved in runtime using
[module-federation/external-remotes-plugin](https://github.com/module-federation/external-remotes-plugin)

*_Synchronization_ refers to [webpack compile hooks](https://webpack.js.org/api/compiler-hooks/)

*_Excessive recompilation_ refers to the fact that the plugin is not smart enough to detect when the typings file is
changed.
Every time a `d.ts` file is downloaded, webpack recompiles the whole bundle because the watcher compares the timestamp
only, which is updated on every download.
